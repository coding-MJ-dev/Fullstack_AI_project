The building has a faulty lift that is rarely working, and the electricity is cut off during daylight hours as part of an economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat in Victory Mansions is located seven flights up and is described as having a telescreen on the wall that cannot be completely shut off. The building is also depicted as having a bleak and oppressive atmosphere, with the poster of the enormous face bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.\"')"
