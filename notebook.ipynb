      "Great choice! Indian cuisine is known for its bold flavors and aromatic spices. Let's start with a classic and popular dish - Chicken Tikka Masala. Here's a simple recipe for you to try at home:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon ginger, minced\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan, for serving\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, half of the minced garlic, half of the minced ginger, and a pinch of salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Stir in the tomato sauce, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Add the cooked chicken tikka to the sauce and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over cooked rice or with naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro and enjoy!\n",
